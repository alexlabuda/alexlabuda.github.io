<p>“There are things that are not of this world, mysterious phenomena that defy explanation. These are the tales of the haunted places in New York.” <br>- Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New York, a city known for its towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, also harbors a less spoken-about aspect: its haunted past. From eerie mansions to historic landmarks, the state of New York is rich with locations that are said to be home to unexplained phenomena and ghostly presences.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we dive into the intriguing world of the paranormal by mapping out some of the most haunted places in New York. Using data visualization techniques with the Leaflet package in R, we bring these chilling tales to life. Each point on the map not only marks a location but also tells the story of its haunting, offering a unique glimpse into the mysterious and the unexplained.</p>
<p>As you explore the map, be prepared to uncover the hidden and eerie side of New York. Each marker is a doorway to a story that blurs the line between reality and the supernatural.</p>
<p>So, let’s embark on this spine-tingling journey and discover what secrets lie in the haunted corners of New York.</p>

The house was used as a base for the British during the Revolutionary War. John Andre was a British Major during the war and visited often. One day Townsend's daughter overheard Andre and John Simcoe (Commander of British Forces) talking about a payment to Benedict Arnold to surrender his troops. The Townsends relayed this information to George Washington. Benedict Arnold escaped, but Andre was captured and hanged. His ghost was first reported here in the 1930s when he was seen on horseback outside a bedroom window. John Andre isn't the only ghost here. Sally Townsend, allegedly John Simcoe's lover is said to still haunt the house. Her former bedroom is always cold, even in the summer the curator wears a warm wool vest in that room! Paranormal investigators have said that whatever is in that room is not happy. In October of 1999 a volunteer was working on the property when the garden door opened and a man came out wearing a dark wool coat with brass buttons.
