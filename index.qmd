Welcome! I’m a Data Scientist and Tableau Developer based in New York.

With a keen focus on leveraging the **power of data science, I empower decision-makers** to tackle complex business challenges and craft effective business intelligence tools to track their success journey.

Currently, I’m part of the dynamic team at **Zion & Zion**, an innovative marketing agency in Arizona, where I blend analytical expertise with creative strategies to drive meaningful results. **My approach is rooted in both the art and science of data**, ensuring that every solution is not just technically sound, but also strategically aligned with business goals.

**Let’s connect** and explore how we can turn data into your most powerful asset!
