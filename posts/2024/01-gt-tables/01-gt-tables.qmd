## What is {`gt`} tables?

![](feature.jpeg)

As we delve into the latest enhancements of the `gt` package in R, let's take a moment to appreciate what `gt` tables is and why it has become an indispensable tool for data scientists and analysts.

> `gt`, short for Grand Tables, is a powerful R package designed to create rich, customizable tables. It stands out in the R ecosystem for its ability to elegantly handle the presentation aspect of data analysis. With `gt`, users can transform basic data frames into professionally styled tables that are not only informative but also visually compelling.

This package excels in its flexibility and ease of use, allowing for detailed adjustments to table formatting, style, and layout. It supports a variety of functionalities such as merging cells, adding footnotes, integrating conditional formatting, and much more, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications.

As we explore the new features of `gt`, we will see how it continues to evolve, further enhancing its capabilities to meet the growing demands of data visualization and reporting in the R community.

## Nanoplots, interactive plots in your **`gt`** table

Nanoplots are compact, interactive visualizations designed for inclusion in `gt` tables. Their main features include:

-   **Compactness**: Designed to be simple and space-efficient, suitable for embedding in tables.

-   **Basic Interactivity**: Users can interact with the plots, like hovering over data points to see values. Variety of Plot Types: Supports different plot styles such as line, bar, and boxplot.

-   **Customizability**: Offers options for customization, including formatting and labeling.

The `cols_nanoplot`() function in `gt` is used to create nanoplots. It allows the selection of specific columns for data, which are then represented in the chosen plot style. These plots can display data compactly and interactively, making them a useful tool for enhancing the presentation of data within tables.

Below is an example of a nanoplot (`plot_tyle = "line"`) in a `gt` table. The plot shows the monthly close price of the S&P 500 from 2016 to 2023.

::: {.callout-tip collapse=false}
## Hover to reveal data points!

You can hover over the nanoplots below to see the values of the data points. If you hover over the left-most plot of the chart area you can also see the range of values in the plot.

```{r}
GSPC_2016_2023 |>
  arrange(-year) |>
  gt(rowname_col = "year") |>
  tab_header(
    title    = md("**SP500** Performance, 2016 - 2024"),
    subtitle = "Monthly Close Price from Yahoo Finance"
    ) |>
  tab_stubhead(label = md("**Year**")) |>
  cols_nanoplot(
    columns       = starts_with("close"),
    new_col_name  = "nanoplots",
    new_col_label = md("*Monthly Close Price*"),
    options = nanoplot_options(
      data_line_stroke_color = "#E91E63",
      data_area_fill_color   = "#E91E63",
      data_point_fill_color  = "#E91E63"
      )
  ) |>
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = nanoplots) |>
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Source: Yahoo Finance",
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = nanoplots)
  ) |> 
  opt_align_table_header(align = "left") |>
  tab_options(heading.padding = px(3)) |> 
  tab_source_note(source_note = md(
    "Data is sourced from `Yahoo Finance` using the **quantmod** package."
  )) |> 
  tab_options(table.width = pct(80))
```



## Interactivity (...with style)

In the latest update of the `gt` package (version 0.9.0), a significant new feature is the introduction of interactive HTML tables. This advancement transforms the way tables are created and interacted with in R, offering a more dynamic and engaging user experience. With this update, `gt` tables become not just a means of displaying data, but an interactive tool for data exploration and presentation. This enhancement aligns with the ongoing evolution of `gt` as a comprehensive solution for data visualization in R, catering to the growing demands for interactivity in data presentation.

```{r}
towny_tbl_styled <-
  towny_tbl |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(population)) |>
  gt() |>
  fmt_number(decimals = 1) |>
  fmt_integer(population) |>
  cols_label_with(
    fn = ~ janitor::make_clean_names(., case = "title")
  ) |>
  data_color(
    columns = density,
    palette = "Reds"
  ) |>
  data_color(
    columns = population,
    palette = "Blues"
  ) |>
  tab_style(
    style = cell_fill(color = "gray98"),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c(latitude, longitude))
  ) |>
  tab_style(
    locations = cells_body(columns = name),
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold")
  ) |>
  opt_interactive(
    use_filters = TRUE,
    use_compact_mode = TRUE,
    use_text_wrapping = FALSE
  )

## Adding a header and footer
towny_tbl_header <-
  towny_tbl_styled |>
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Population** and **Density** Data"),
    subtitle = "Arranged from largest to smallest municipality"
  ) |>
  opt_align_table_header(align = "left") |>
  tab_options(heading.padding = px(1))

towny_tbl_header |>
  tab_source_note(source_note = md(
    "Data taken from the `towny` dataset in the **gt** package."
  )) |>
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Density here is the population divided by
    the land area.",
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = density)
  ) |>
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Population values obtained from the 2021 census.",
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = population)
  ) |>
  opt_footnote_marks(marks = c("†", "‡")) |>
  opt_footnote_spec(spec_ref = "i", spec_ftr = "i")
```

## Closing thoughts
