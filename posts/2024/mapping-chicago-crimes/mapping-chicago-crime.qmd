## 2015 Chicago Crimes: Mere data or deep insights?

*[WORK IN PROGRESS]* 

![](feature.png)

Welcome to a deep dive into the world of data visualization and analysis, focusing on one of the most pressing urban issues: crime. In this blog post, we're going to explore the intricate patterns of crime in Chicago for the year 2015. Leveraging the power of Leaflet for interactive mapping and the versatility of {gt} tables, we'll uncover the hidden stories behind the numbers.

This journey isn't just about numbers and statistics; it's about understanding the geographic distribution and frequency of various types of crimes in one of America's largest cities. We'll visualize this data in a way that's both insightful and accessible, even if you're not a data scientist. From the most common crimes to the hotspots of criminal activities, our analysis will provide a comprehensive look at the crime landscape of Chicago in 2015.

So, whether you're a data enthusiast, a policy maker, a Chicago resident, or simply curious, join us as we map out the contours of crime in the Windy City, discovering patterns and insights that could inform future strategies and solutions.

    lng = ~longitude, 
    lat = ~latitude, 
    radius = ~n * 0.5,
